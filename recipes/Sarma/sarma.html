        <li>Arrange a few cabbage leaves on the bottom of the larger sherpa. Take, one by one, a cabbage leaf, put one spoonful of meat filling on each one and wrap the leaves in small firm rolls. Pull the ends of the cabbage well, so that the hope does not fall out during cooking. Arrange the sarma in a sherpa, side by side, in several rows. Wash the dried meat and bacon in hot water, cut it into pieces, and place it between the rows of sarma. Add 5-6 peppercorns and 2 bay leaves. Pour cold water over the sarma and cook on low heat for about 3-4 hours. In a pan, make a powder of 50 g of fat, a spoonful of flour and one teaspoon of allspice, pour over the sarma, cover the sherpa and let it boil for another half an hour. Instead of bread with sarma, serve proja.</li>
