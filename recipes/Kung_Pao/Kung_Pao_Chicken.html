    <p>Kung Pao chicken, also transcribed Gong Bao or Kung Po, is a spicy, stir-fried Chinese dish made with cubes of chicken, peanuts, vegetables, and chili peppers.</p>
    <p>The classic dish in Sichuan cuisine originated in the Sichuan Province of south-western China and includes Sichuan peppercorns.</p>

    <p><strong>The main ingredients for Kung Pao Chicken are:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>Soy sauce (or tamari)</li>
        <li>Vinegar (rice vinegar or sherry vinegar)</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>Red & green bell peppers</li>
        <li>Green onions</li>
        <li>Cashews</li>
        <li>Driedred chili peppers</li>
        <li>Fresh garlic & ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to Make Kung Pao Chicken:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Kung Pao sauce: mix the soy sauce, vinegar and sugar in a bowl. (yeah, itâ€™s that simple.)</li>
        <li>Prep the chicken! Cut the boneless, skinless chicken breast into uniform strips. This is a little easier to do if your chicken is slightly frozen. Then, toss it in a little soy sauce and cornstarch to coat.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken until crispy! Working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, stir-fry the chicken pieces in sesame oil until they're cooked through and gorgeously crispy.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry! Stir-fry the bell peppers until they're a little soft. Then add the scallions, cashews, ginger, garlic, and dried chili peppers. Stir fry all of that for a minute or two, and then stir in the Kung Pao sauce and cooked chicken.</li>
        <li>Simmer. Let all of the flavors meld over the heat for a few more minutes. The Kung Pao sauce will thicken slightly and really coat the veggies and chicken, which is what you want.</li>
        <li>Serve! We love to serve this over steaming bowls of white or brown rice.</li>
